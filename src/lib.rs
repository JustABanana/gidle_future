//! An executor to run futures in the idle cycles of a Glib/Gtk application.
//!
//! This crate provides a function that programs a future to be run using the
//! _idle_ time of the main loop, as provided by [`glib::idle_add`](../glib/source/fn.idle_add.html).
//!
//! It works by registering an idle function to poll the future once, and whenever the future is
//! awoken, it will register another idle function to be continued, and so on.
//!
//! The main advantage of this approach is that the future is run in the main loop.
//! As such, it does not need to be `Send`, it does not require any kind of synchronization
//! to access shared state, and it can even manipulate GUI objects directly.
//!
//! Naturally, you still need to be careful, because if you set up several idle futures at the same
//! time they will be run intermixed.
//!
//! # What can it be used for?
//!
//! You can use this crate to implement async I/O that handles the GUI without the need of
//! synchronization. For example you can download assets or updates from the internet, or provide
//! an API for automating your GUI.
//!
//! You can also use async functions to implement background tasks that run when the program is
//! idle. They can be interrupted at any time and they can update the GUI directly. A similar
//! technique can be used to easily build a progress bar for a long-running process. Just add
//! something like this call here and there:
//! ```
//! async_std::task::yield_now().await;
//! ```
//!
//! # Working with other async frameworks
//!
//! You can run almost any future as an idle future, but if it uses functionality from any async
//! framework (`async_std`, `smol`, `tokio`...) it will most likely need to be initialized first,
//! or else your futures will not advance. This is because these frameworks usually work by creating
//! a background thread that does the actual polling and wakes up the other futures. If this
//! background thread is not created, nothing will be polled and your futures will stall forever.
//!
//! You may think that interacting with other fraworks is going to be difficult. But actually it is
//! super easy, barely an inconvenience:
//!
//! ## `async_std`
//!
//! Spawning any async task will bootstrap the runtime, so just this from your `main` is enough:
//! ```
//! async_std::task::spawn(async {});
//! ```
//!
//! ## `smol`
//!
//! There must be at least one thread runing an async job, and it will do that and poll all the
//! futures. So the code would be something like this, that will spawn a never-ending future:
//! ```
//! std::thread::spawn(|| smol::run(futures::future::pending::<()>()));
//! ```
//! If you also use `async_std`, since it uses `smol` under the hood, you just need one of these.
//!
//! ## `tokio`
//!
//! In `tokio` futures need to be spawn from a tokio reactor. It is enough if you run your main loop from there:
//! ```
//!     let mut rt = tokio::runtime::Builder::new()
//!       .threaded_scheduler()
//!       .enable_all()
//!       .build()
//!       .unwrap();
//!    rt.block_on(async { gtk::main() });
//!```
//!
//!Or you can decorate your `main` function with:
//!```
//!#[tokio::main]
//!async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!    //...
//!}
//!```
